# Requirement

...  

> A requirement is a usable representation of a need. Requirements focus on understanding what kind of value could be delivered if a requirement is fulfilled. The nature of the representation may be a document (or set of documents), but can vary widely depending on the circumstances. [^1]

> A requirement is simply a statement of what the system must do or what characteristic it must have. [^2]
