...  

> In UML, an actor is any person, organization, machine, or third-party system that interacts with the system you are modeling. [^1] 

> An actor is not a specific user, but a role that a user can play while interacting with the system. An actor can also represent another system in which the current system interacts. [^2]

> An actor is someone or something that interacts with the system.  [^3]
