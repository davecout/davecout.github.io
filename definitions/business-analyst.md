# Business Analyst

...  

> The business analyst is inherently a stakeholder in all business analysis activities. The BABOK Guide presumes that the business analyst is responsible and accountable for the execution of these activities. In some cases the business analyst may also be responsible for performing activities that fall under another stakeholder role. [^1]
