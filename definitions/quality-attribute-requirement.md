# Quality Attribute Requirement

...  

> These requirements are qualifications of the functional requirements or of the overall product. A qualification of a functional requirement is an item such as how fast the function must be performed, or how resilient it must be to erronous input. A qualification of the overall product is an item such as the time to deploy the product or a limitation on operational costs. [^1]
