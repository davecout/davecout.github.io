# System Architecture

...  

> A system's architecture is a representation of a system in which there is a mapping of funcitonality onto hardware and software components, a mapping of the software architecture onto the hardware architecture, and a concern for the human interaction with these components. That is, system architecture is concerned with a total system, including hardware, software, and humans. [^1]
