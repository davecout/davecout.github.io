# Business Actor

...  

> In the case of business actors and use cases, the [systems](actor.html) previously mentionned would be business. UML is very careful to suggest that the actor represents a role, not a specific person or job title (which would be an entity). [...] Typical business actors include customers, prospective customers (also known as prospects), outside sales agents, shippers, goods suppliers, tax auditors, and so on. [^1]
