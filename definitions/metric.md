> A metric is a quantifiable measure that is used to track and assess the status of a specific process. If you're confused because we haven't yet covered "measure," get this: according to the Oxford dictionary, the word measure is derived from the Latin word "metiri." In others words, their meanings are almost identical-which is why you may find them used interchangeably. That said, here is the difference: a measure is a fundamental or unit-specific term-a metric can literally be derived from one or more measures. This is why the term metric has a more goal or performance nuance attached to it. [^1]
