> Testers are responsible for determining how to verify that the solution meets the requirements defined by the business analyst, as well as conducting the
verification process. Testers also seek to ensure that the solution meets applicable quality standards, and that the risk of defects or failures is understood and
minimized. An alternate role is quality assurance analyst. [^1]
