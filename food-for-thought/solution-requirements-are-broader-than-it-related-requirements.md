# Solution Requirements are Broader than IT Related Requirements

<div itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">
    <span itemprop="articleBody">To achieve business requirements, stakeholders need to adapt and change their current activities and tasks. Optimizing processes may be achieved by using information technologies (IT). However, process optimization also includes activities for improving performance by systematically removing waste and reducing variation. Optimizing processes to meet business requirements does not always require IT which means that solutions used to meet those objectives are broader than only IT solutions. Enterprise and solution architects must cover the whole spectrum of the enterprise which includes business and IT.</span>
